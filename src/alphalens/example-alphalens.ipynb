    "Alphales is a tool that analyzes a factor ability to predict future returns, that is Alphalens verify and highlights the correlation between factor predictions and future returns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively a factor is the model used to explain the asset returns and it is used to predict the future assets price or  return. The factor assigns a value, the score, to each asset in the trading universe that represents the prediction for the asset future returns. Classical examples of factors are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Momentum, which scores the stocks based in long term performance (e.g. last year returns) with the expectation that the stocks keep performing accordingly\n",
    "- Mean reversion, which scores the stocks by the inverse of recent performance (e.g. last 5 days returns) with the expectation that the stocks prices revert to a rolling mean\n",
    "- Volatility, which scores the stocks by the inverse of standard deviation of returns\n",
    "- Size, which scores small-cap stocks higher than high-cap stocks\n",
    "- Fundamental Analysis in general (Value, Quality, etc. )\n",
    "- Technical Analysis in general (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.)\n",
    "- Sentiment factors\n",
    "\n",
    "Alphalens receives in input historical factor values together with assets prices (or returns) and then compares the factor predictions with actual historical assets performance providing a report of this analysis. The report clearly establishes if the factor is effective in explaining assets returns and it also quantifies the prediction accuracy of the factor."

    "During the research phase we are  interested in understanding what are the characteristics of a factor so that it becomes clear how we can best trade that factor. While backtesting can perform a detailed simulation of the market (commissions, slippage, assets liquidity) and give very realistic expectations of how an algorithm would perform in live trading, it lacks the ability to assess the quality and characteristics of the factor itself. If a backtest shows good results we know the factor has alpha but we don't know the best parameters to maximize that. When a backtest shows bad performance we are in a even worse situation because we don't know anything about the factor (we might have chosen the wrong parameters or the factor might don't have alpha). On the other hand when a factor is analysed with Alphalens it becomes clear if there is alpha and the best way to trade that factor. Once this information is known then we can start backtesting to verify the alpha is actually tradable, that is it survives commissions, slippage and stocks availability (liquidity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at an Alphalens report we can answer questions such as:\n",
    "- Is the factor predictive at all?\n",
    "- How much is predictive the factor?\n",
    "- Is the factor consistent across the the full stocks universe?\n",
    "- How many assets should I trade in the long leg? and on the short one?\n",
    "- What weighting scheme should I use: factor weighting or equal weighting?\n",
    "- What holding period should I use? Should I rebalance every day or every week?\n",
    "- What is the turnover for different holding periods?\n",
    "- Does the factor performs well across all sectors? Can we trade the factor in a sector neutral strategy?\n",
    "- How does the factor perform across different level of volatility, market cap, asset price, momentum, book-to-price ratios, Beta exposure etc. ?"

    "Alphalens is a versatile tool, it can be used with a broad range of strategies and we want to show here some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "A strategy idea can be as easy as looking at fundamentals, for example a [Value](https://www.quantopian.com/lectures/case-study-traditional-value-factor) or [Quality](https://www.quantopian.com/posts/quality-factors-1) factor. There is a full range of [fundamentals availbale on Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com/help#ide-fundamentals).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alphalens can also be used to evaluate [alternative datasets](https://www.quantopian.com/data) such as sentiment analysis, CEO Changes, Buyback Authorizations, Mergers&Acquisitions and many mores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another range of strategies that can be easily verified are the ones that belong to the technical analisys. There are several technical indicators already implemented in zipline as [built-in factor](https://github.com/quantopian/zipline/blob/master/zipline/pipeline/factors/technical.py) (e.g. RSI, BollingerBands, Aroon, FastStochasticOscillator, IchimokuKinkoHyo, TrueRange,, etc.), but we can also code one by ourself if that's not already provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we might stumble across an interesting algorithm, for example [Mean Reversion](https://www.quantopian.com/posts/enhancing-short-term-mean-reversion-strategies-1) or  [Andreas Clenow's Momentum](https://www.quantopian.com/posts/equity-momentum), and we wonder what drives the performance of that strategy. So we find ourself cloning the algorithm, change some settings here and there, running backtests but we donâ€™t easily grasp the core of the strategy. This is because an algorithm has too many variables and details, it's difficult to separate the strategy idea from the way it is implemented. Instead, if we isolate the alpha from the algorithm, code that in a factor and analyze that with Alphalens we can understand what is it really going on. After understanding the idea it is easier to look at the algorithm and make a sense out of the implementation details and maybe improve the strategy."

In this plot there are actually two different points in time: the present is the X axis, which defines the quantiles and is an information available at trading time, and the future is the Y axis, the mean forward return that a specific quantile generates on average. This latter information is not know at trading decision time, but if a factor has proven to be consistent in the past there is a good chance it keeps performing well.\n",

The rate of return is the value the returns would have been every day if they had grown at a steady rate. Alphalens uses the shortest period length as the base time frequency over which computing the rate of returns. So, for example, if we had 1, 5, and 10 days periods Alphalens would compute 1 day rate of retuns for all the periods and if we had 10 and 30 days (or minutes) as periods Alphalens would compute 10 days (or minutes) rate of returns. \n",

    "\n",
    "Letâ€™s consider for example a 5 days period. A first solution could be to trade the factor every 5 days instead of daily. Unfortunately this approach has several drawbacks. One is that depending on the starting day of the algorithm we get different results, but the most important issue comes from [The Fundamental Law of Asset Management](https://www.quantopian.com/lectures/why-you-should-hedge-beta-and-sector-exposures-part-i) which states:\n",

    "\n",
    "Given a period N, the cumulative returns are computed building and averaging N interleaved sub portfolios (each started at subsequent periods 1,2,..,N) each one rebalancing every N periods and each trading 1/Nth of the initial capital. This corresponds to an algorithm which split its initial capital in N sub capitals and trades each sub capital independently, each one rebalancing every N  days. Since the sub portfolios are started in subsequent days the algorithm trades every single day. \n",

    "Compared to an algorithm that trades the factor every N day, this method increases the IR , has lower volatility, the returns are independent from the starting day and, very important, the algorithm capacity is increased by N times since the capital is split between N subportfolios and the slippage impact is decreased by N.\n",

There is only one caveat: sectors data has discrete values while other groups might not, so we need a way to discretize contiguous data values.
